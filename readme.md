Scroll Jump
==================
By Weng Fei Fung.
When you scroll down a long page with many sections, you have to put in much effort to find the section. With this tool, a dropdown appears for a short while as you scroll, and that dropdown lets you select a section to jump to. So you can either scroll or have it scroll to the section for you.
